# instagrambot

I made this bot for those of you who have a computer that is running 24 hours or if you have a linux server. This bot is made to run on windows and linux OS. You can download it at the url I have provided at this video's description text. 

This bot has advantages such as, for example, it can select feeds that match a particular hashtag, unfollow users who do not follow you, unfollow users who are not active, mention usernames in comments and most importantly it runs at random intervals. This bot is also very light and does not require a lot of memory because it does not need to run a browser.
